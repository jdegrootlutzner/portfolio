        <p>At Zipperfield, I served as the lead developer and product manager for the creation of the Honeybis website. Honeybis is a CBD infused honey start-up based in Philadelphia. You can <a href="https://honeybis.com/">view the live website here</a> and read on to learn about my role as the project manager and the design process I oversaw.</p>
        <h4>As project manager...</h4>
        <p>As project manager, I took on many responsibilities. First, I pursued, pitched, and acquired the client. Then, I scoped and formalized a contract, which detailed the projects deliverables and time frame. Throughout the duration of the project, I served as the communication point between the client, a logo designer, and my team at Zipperfield. Also, I hired a 3D designer to create an animation for the website. Finally, I built out the custom design on top of a WordPress website. </p>
        <p>From previous projects, I learned the value of a detailed contract. Since website creation is made up of many moving parts, it is important to have both our team and the client in agreement about the expectations of the project. If the client wants to make a major change when the project is nearly finished, we are happy to do this, but the change will require a new work order. </p> 
        <p>From previous projects, I also learned the importance of using the simplest tool for the job. It is easier to make changes to the design in Figma, then it is to make changes to the design in code. The design process I oversaw attempted to establish the content and functionality of the website before its design, and then establish the design before the code. </p>
        <h4>The Design Process</h4>
        <p>For the Honeybis website, I orchestrated a multi-stage design process, which provided continuous checkpoints and clarity to the client.  </p>
        <p>For the first part of the design process, my business partner and I designed a low-fidelity wireframe. A low-fidelity wireframe is a simple, black and white design focused on communicating the content and functionality of the website. </p>
        <img src="/assets/honeybis/honeybis-low-fidelity.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the low fidelity wireframe in Figma">
        <p class="italic">The Honeybis Low-fidelity wireframe</p>
        <p>We approached the low-fidelity wireframe with a strength/weakness framework. How could we highlight the product's top three features, and how could we address the client's top three concerns? Additionally, we researched competitors and other food websites to formulate our goals for the website.</p>
        <p>Next, my business partner designed three "heroes" to establish the websites design language.</p>
        <p>A "hero" is the first thing a user will see when they visit a website. The user must quickly be able to tell why the website exists so they can decide whether to continue to explore it. As such, its important to make a good first impression!</p> 
        <p>A design language is the overarching guide to the style of the website. It is made up of the colors, aesthetic, typography, and feeling that the design should evoke. </p> 
        <p>In preliminary branding discussions, the client asked for a design with a black background and gold text and a design language similar to Apple. Designing and presenting three heroes allowed for us to both design in the client's vision, while also maintaining space to explore other design opportunities. A techy black background is atypical for food branding so my business partner also created a design with a light background and bright text.</p>
        <img src="/assets/honeybis/hero-choices.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="italic">Three choices in hero design</p>
        <p>After the client signed off on the low-fidelity wireframe and chose their preferred hero, my business partner got to work on finalizing the final design. </p>
        <p>While my business partner designed the final design, I story-boarded the animation, which would be central to the hero of the webpage. When my client described their vision for the website, I pitched a 3D animation similar to Apple's product websites. The pitch helped secured the contract, but then I had to figure out how to actually make it happen! </p>
        <p>I have worked in Cinema 4D before, but I did not want the animation creation to become a time-absorbing personal learning project. Instead, I prototyped the animation with my iPhone camera and storyboarded the animation in Figma as a way to communicate my vision to a 3D designer.</p>
        <img src="/assets/honeybis/animation-storyboard.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="italic">Honeybis animation storyboard</p>
        <p> Once the designer completed the video, I spent my energy learning how to convert the video into an optimized animation for the web. I used the Bodymovin plug-in for After Effects, which turns an image sequence into a Lottie animation. Lottie is an open source file format that creates "tiny, high quality, and interactive" animations for the web.</p>
        <p>Responsive web design is about considering every user, not just every screen size. An important user to consider is one with a slow internet connection. I spent a lot of energy optimizing the size of the video format to quicken the website load time. Additionally, I added a backup photo in the case that a user could not load the full animation. </p>
        <p>The biggest take away for me in this project were not the technical lessons, but the skills I developed as a project manager. Thanks for reading!</p>
