        <h4>Gaining experience as a product manager.</h4>
        <p>At Zipperfield, I served as the lead developer and product manager for the creation of the Honeybis website. Honeybis is a CBD honey start-up based in Philadelphia. You can <a href="https://honeybis.com/">view the live website here</a> and read on to learn about my role as a project manager and the design process.</p>
        <h4>As project manager...</h4>
        <p>As project manager, I took on many responsibilities. First, I pursued, pitched, and aquired the client. Then, I scoped and formalized a contract, which detailed the projects deliverables and timeframe. Throughout the duration of the project, I served as the communication point between the client, a logo designer, and my team at Zipperfield. Also, I hired a 3D designer to create a 3D animation for the website. Finally, I built out the custom design on top of a WordPress website. </p>
        <p>From previous projects, I learned the value in a detailed contract. Since website creation is made up of many moving parts, it is important to have both our team and the client in agreement about the scope of the project. If the client wants to make a major change when the project is nearly finished, we are happy to do this, but the change will require a new work order. </p> 
        <p>From previous projects I also learned the importance of using the simplest tool for the job. It is easier to make changes to the design in Figma, then it is to make changes to the design in code. The design process I oversaw attempted to establish the content and functionality of the website before its design, and then establish the design before the code. I utilized this framework within the design process.</p>
        <h4>The Design Process</h4>
        <p>For this project, I orchestrated a multi-stage design process, which provided continuous checkpoints and clarity to the client.  </p>
        <p>For the first part of the design process, my business partner and I designed a low-fidelity wireframe. A low-fidelity wireframe is a simple, black and white design focused on communicating the content and functionality of the website. </p>
        <img src="/assets/honeybis/honeybis-low-fidelity.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the low fidelity wireframe in Figma">
        <p class="italic">Honeybis Low-fidelity wireframe</p>
        <p>We approached the wireframe with this question: how could we highlight the products top three features, and how could we address the client's top three concerns? Additionally, we researched competitors and brainstormed ideas to formulate our goals for the website.</p>
        <p>Next, my business partner designed three "heros" to establish the websites design language.</p>
        <p>A "hero" is the first thing a user will see when they visit a website. The user must quickly be able to tell why the website exists so they can decide whether to continue to explore it. A design language is the overarching guide to the style of the design and is made up of the colors, aesthetic, typography, and feeling that the design should envoke. </p> 
        <p>In preliminary branding discussions, the client asked for a design similar to Apple but with a black background and gold text. Designing and presenting three heros allowed for us to both design to the clients vision, while maintaining space to explore other design opportunities. A techy black background is untypical for food branding so my business partner also created a design with a white background and bright text.</p>

        <p class="italic">Three choices in hero design</p>
        <p>After the client signed off on the low-fidelity wireframe and chose their preferred hero, my business partner got to work on finalizing the final design. </p>
        <p>While my business partner designed the final design, I storyboarded the animation, which would be central to the hero of the webpage. In the storyboard, I </p>
